## Compiler
The goal of this project was to develop a compiler. A compiler takes source code written in high level languages such as python and C and converts it into machine code which can be interpreted by the CPU of the computer. Compilers have a front-end and back-end interface. Our focus during this project was to implement the front-end of a compiler which consists of a lexer and parser. Our stretch goal was to implement a code generator back-end interface which we unfortunately were not able to accomplish. 

## Lexer (lexer.h lexer.c)
Lexers are the first front-end component of compilers. A lexer intakes the source code and converts it to tokens where a token is a simplified representation of each component of the source code. For example, if a lexer is given “ 3 + 4” the tokens generated would be as follows:  “3” is a number token, “+” is an operator token,  and “4” is another number token.  

## Parser (parser.h parser.c)
Parsers are the second front-end component of compilers. A parser takes in tokens generated by the lexer and makes expressions from it to interpret the source code. In doing so, the parser creates an abstract syntax tree.
