## Lexing and Parsing 

1) Lexing and Parsing Lecture from UMD. This was used as a basis for understanding these processes. (https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2017/cmsc430/slides/03-lexing-parsing.pdf) 

2) Lexing versus Parsing. This was used to understand the difference between these processes. (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-lexer-and-a-parser) 

3) Lexer Explanation. (https://dev.to/lefebvre/compilers-101---overview-and-lexer-3i0m)

4) Parser Explanation Stanford Lecture. (https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs143/cs143.1156/handouts/parsing.pdf)

5) How to Parse a File in C. (https://bytes.com/topic/c/insights/657086-how-parse-file-c) 

6) Lecture on how to make a toy compiler with explanations of all major steps. Rishita and Grant worked through this tutorial to implement a functioning arithmetic performing toy compiler. (https://cop3402fall20.github.io/lectures/03_toy_compiler.html)

7) LLVM Tutorial. Abitamim worked through this tutorial and converted code from C++ to C for the lexer and parser. (https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html) 

8) A BASIC dialect compiler with while loop implementation. This was the basis for while loop logic. (https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html)
