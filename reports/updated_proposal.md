# Comp-lexity

## Project Goal

Our team is hoping to dig deeper into the inner workings of compilers by building the first building blocks of one. We will be focusing on a very small subset of commands within both a language and an instruction set. 

We have found resources that guide us through making a compiler for languages very similar to the toy language we have created. We will create extensive documentation of these tutorials to make them easier to understand. We hope to use this content as a resource for those who are interested in the mechanics of compilers. We hope to also add functionality to these basic compilers such as conditionals and loops.

## Learning Goals

We have a basic understanding of the steps compilers take to get higher-level code down to machine code for execution. However, we do not have much insight into the mechanics by which each step is executed. Diving in deeper to the granularity of compilation will give us perspective to understand why our higher-level programs execute the way they do. We want to understand the architecture of lexers and parsers, and we want to explore how they interact with later stages in the process. We also hope to understand the high-level design decisions that go into creating a compiler.

## Preparation

We have found several very useful resources on the workings of compilers, specifically on the lexer and parser stages. Our resources are located in [resources](../resources/links.txt).

## Getting Started

We began this project by doing extensive research into the workings of compilers, and we also made progress working through the tutorials we found. We are currently redelegating tasks, with the hope of having two teams working on conditionals and loops. Before we can split tasks, we are meeting to determine how the parsing and linking algorithm will need to change with new compiler mechanics (right now it is only configured to work on numbers, operators, semicolons, and EOFs).
