1) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

2) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

3) What have you done to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?  If you found any resources you think I should add to the list on the class web page, please email them to me.

4) What are you working on now?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you are working on, and identify which members of the team are working on them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?
