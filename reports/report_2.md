# Comp-lexity Project Report 2
Rishita Sarin, Grant Miner, Abitamim Bharmal

## Project Goal
This project, we are planning to build on our our toy compiler project from last time and add code generation capability to it. The idea is to take the output from the parser and output assembly code in x86. This assembly code can be put into pre-existing webpages such as https://godbolt.org/ to execute it. Our lower bound is to add code generation for variable declaration, arithmetic operations with 2 operands and 1 operator, and if/else statements. Time permitting, out upper bound would be to execute the same for while loops.

## Learning Goals

We all share the same learning goals this project. Our primary goal is to learn and gain experience in x86 assembly language. We also hope to develop our skills of working in a team based software project with a special focus in delegation of tasks, keeping up with documentation, and maintaing communication within the team via regular syncs.

Rishita was originally also interested in pursuing the tasks related to being a PM on a software project team. However, as it turns out there are not too many PM related tasks within this team. We have all mutually delegated tasks and maintained communication. Thereby, Rishita has pivoted her learning goals to gain experience in writing code from scratch in C (in addition to learning about x86). 

Grant has wanted to develop a moderate ability to translate code into assembly by hand, and he is looking forward to validating the code generation for the test files.

Abitamim wants to learn assembly and how code changes can result in assembly changes. He also wants to learn how to structure code generation to allow for efficient traversal of the syntax tree.
