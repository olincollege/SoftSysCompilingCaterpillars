# Comp-lexity

## Project Goal

Our team is hoping to dig deeper into the inner workings of compilers by building the first building blocks of one. We will be focusing on a very small subset of commands within both a language and an instruction set. 

We will be attempting to make a lexical analyzer for a very limited subset of commands. We will be restricting our types to integers and our operations to simple arithmetic. We believe this will pose a sufficient challenge, and it has inherent room for stretch goals. 

## Learning Goals

We have a basic understanding of the steps compilers take to get higher-level code down to machine code for execution. However, we do not have much insight into the mechanics by which each step is executed. Diving in deeper to the granularity of compilation will give us perspective to understand why our higher-level programs execute the way they do. This can also be a chance to build a jumping off point for future projects in this space.

## Preparation

We are still on the hunt for reliable resources to scaffold our learning and development. We have found some resources which walk through building a new language that have some information on compilers.

## Getting Started

To begin this project, we will need to do extensive research into the workings of lexers. To start off, we will all research the mechanics of lexers in a variety of resources. We will synthesize our research into internal documentation for later reference that could possibly be passed on as educational material for future iterations of this course.
