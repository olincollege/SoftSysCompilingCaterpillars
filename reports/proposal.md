# The Basics of Compilation

## Project Goal

Our team is hoping to dig deeper into the inner workings of compilers by building the first building blocks of one. We will be focusing on a very small subset of commands within both a language and an instruction set. 

To begin building understanding of compilers, we will attempt to execute the preprocessing and parsing stages of compilation. Together, we believe these will pose a considerable challenge. If we are more successful than expected, we may begin tackling the static checking stage of compilation.

## Learning Goals

We have a basic understanding of the steps compilers take to get higher-level code down to machine code for execution. However, we do not have much insight into the mechanics by which each step is executed. Diving in deeper to the granularity of compilation will give us perspective to understand why our higher-level programs execute the way they do. 

## Preparation

We are still on the hunt for reliable resources to scaffold our learning and development. We have found some resources which walk through building a new language that have some information on compilers.

## Getting Started

To begin this project, we will need to do extensive research into the workings of lexers, syntactic analysis, and semantic analysis. [FIT in WHICH PERSON IS DOING WHICH THING]. We will synthesize our research into internal documentation for later reference. We will continue digging over the course of the project.
